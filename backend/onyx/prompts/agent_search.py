IMPORTANT RULES:
 - If you cannot reliably answer the question solely using the provided information, say that you cannot reliably answer. \
You may give some additional facts you learned, but do not try to invent an answer.

 - If the information is empty or irrelevant, just say "{UNKNOWN_ANSWER}".

 - If the information is relevant but not fully conclusive, provide an answer to the extent you can but also specify that \
the information is not conclusive and why.

- When constructing/considering categories, focus less on the question and more on the context actually provided! \
Example: if the question is about the products of company A, and the content provided lists a number of products, \
do automatically NOT ASSUME that those belong to company A!  So you cannot list those as products of company A, despite \
the fact that the question is about company A's products. What you should say instead is maybe something like \
"Here are a number of products, but I cannot say whether some or all of them belong to company A: \
<proceed with listing the products>". It is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL that the answer constructed reflects \
actual knowledge. For that matter, also consider the title of the document and other information that may be \
provided. If that does not make it clear that - in the example above - the products belong to company A, \
then do not list them as products of company A, just maybe as "A list products that may not necessarily \
belong to company A". THIS IS IMPORTANT!

- Related, if the context provides a list of items with associated data or other information that seems \
to align with the categories in the question, but does not specify whether the items or the information is \
specific to the exact requested category, then present the information with a disclaimer. Use a title such as \
"I am not sure whether these items (or the information provided) is specific to [relevant category] or whether \
these are all [specific group], but I found this information may be helpful:" \
followed by the list of items and associated data/or information discovered.

 - Do not group together items amongst one headline where not all items belong to the category of the headline! \
(Example: "Products used by Company A" where some products listed are not built by Company A, but other companies,
or it is not clear that the products are built by Company A). Only state what you know for sure!

 - Do NOT perform any calculations in the answer! Just report on facts.

 - If appropriate, organizing your answer in bullet points is often useful.

The purpose for these sub-questions could be:
  1) decomposition to isolate individual entities (i.e., 'compare sales of company A and company B' -> \
['what are sales for company A', 'what are sales for company B'])

  2) clarification and/or disambiguation of ambiguous terms (i.e., 'what is our success with company A' -> \

'is company A a reference customer for us', etc.])

  3) if a term or a metric is essentially clear, but it could relate to various aspects of an entity and you \
are generally familiar with the entity, then you can create sub-questions that are more \
specific (i.e.,  'what do we do to improve product X' -> 'what do we do to improve scalability of product X', \
'what do we do to improve performance of product X', 'what do we do to improve stability of product X', ...)

  4) research individual questions and areas that should really help to ultimately answer the question.

Important:

 - Each sub-question should lend itself to be answered by a RAG system. Correspondingly, phrase the question \
in a way that is amenable to that. An example set of sub-questions based on an initial question could look like this:
'what can I do to improve the performance of workflow X' -> \
'what are the settings affecting performance for workflow X', 'are there complaints and bugs related to \
workflow X performance', 'what are performance benchmarks for workflow X', ...

 - Consequently, again, don't just decompose, but make sure that the sub-questions have the proper form. I.e., no \
 'I', etc.

 - Do not(!) create sub-questions that are clarifying question to the person who asked the question, \
like making suggestions or asking the user for more information! This is not useful for the actual \
question-answering process! You need to take the information from the user as it is given to you! \
For example, should the question be of the type 'why does product X perform poorly for customer A', DO NOT create a \

# REFINEMENT PHASE
REFINEMENT_QUESTION_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT = f"""
An initial user question needs to be answered. An initial answer has been provided but it wasn't quite good enough. \
Also, some sub-questions had been answered and this information has been used to provide the initial answer. \
Some other subquestions may have been suggested based on little knowledge, but they were not directly answerable. \
Also, some entities, relationships and terms are given to you so that you have an idea of how the available data looks like.

Your role is to generate 2-4 new sub-questions that would help to answer the initial question, considering:

1) The initial question
2) The initial answer that was found to be unsatisfactory
3) The sub-questions that were answered
4) The sub-questions that were suggested but not answered
5) The entities, relationships and terms that were extracted from the context

The individual questions should be answerable by a good RAG system. So a good idea would be to use the sub-questions to \
resolve ambiguities and/or to separate the question for different entities that may be involved in the original question, \
but in a way that does not duplicate questions that were already tried.

Additional Guidelines:
- The sub-questions should be specific to the question and provide richer context for the question, resolve ambiguities, \
or address shortcoming of the initial answer
- Each sub-question - when answered - should be relevant for the answer to the original question
- The sub-questions should be free from comparisons, ambiguities,judgements, aggregations, or any other complications that \
may require extra context
- The sub-questions MUST have the full context of the original question so that it can be executed by a RAG system \
independently without the original question available

    - initial question: "What is the capital of France?"
    - bad sub-question: "What is the name of the river there?"
    - good sub-question: "What is the name of the river that flows through Paris?"
- For each sub-question, please also provide a search term that can be used to retrieve relevant documents from a document store.
- Consider specifically the sub-questions that were suggested but not answered. This is a sign that they are not answerable \
with the available context, and you should not ask similar questions.
 - Do not(!) create sub-questions that are clarifying question to the person who asked the question, \
like making suggestions or asking the user for more information! This is not useful for the actual \
question-answering process! You need to take the information from the user as it is given to you! \
For example, should the question be of the type 'why does product X perform poorly for customer A', DO NOT create a \
sub-question of the type 'what are the settings that customer A uses for product X?'! A valid sub-question \
could rather be 'which settings for product X have been shown to lead to poor performance for customers?'

REFINEMENT_QUESTION_DECOMPOSITION_PROMPT_W_INITIAL_SUBQUESTION_ANSWERS = f"""
An initial user question needs to be answered. An initial answer has been provided but it wasn't quite good enough. \
Also, some sub-questions had been answered and this information has been used to provide the initial answer. \
Some other subquestions may have been suggested based on little knowledge, but they were not directly answerable. \
Also, some entities, relationships and terms are given to you so that you have an idea of how the available data looks like.

Your role is to generate 2-4 new sub-questions that would help to answer the initial question, considering:

1) The initial question
2) The initial answer that was found to be unsatisfactory
3) The sub-questions that were answered AND their answers
4) The sub-questions that were suggested but not answered (and that you should not repeat!)
5) The entities, relationships and terms that were extracted from the context

The individual questions should be answerable by a good RAG system. So a good idea would be to use the sub-questions to \
resolve ambiguities and/or to separate the question for different entities that may be involved in the original question, \
but in a way that does not duplicate questions that were already tried.

Additional Guidelines:

- The new sub-questions should be specific to the question and provide richer context for the question, resolve ambiguities, \
or address shortcoming of the initial answer

- Each new sub-question - when answered - should be relevant for the answer to the original question

- The new sub-questions should be free from comparisons, ambiguities,judgements, aggregations, or any other complications that \
may require extra context

- The new sub-questions MUST have the full context of the original question so that it can be executed by a RAG system \
independently without the original question available
    Example:
    - initial question: "What is the capital of France?"
    - bad sub-question: "What is the name of the river there?"
    - good sub-question: "What is the name of the river that flows through Paris?"

    - For each new sub-question, please also provide a search term that can be used to retrieve relevant documents \
from a document store.

- Consider specifically the sub-questions that were suggested but not answered. This is a sign that they are not answerable \
with the available context, and you should not ask similar questions.

- Pay attention to the answers of previous sub-question to make your sub-questions more specific! \
Often the initial sub-questions were set up to give you critical information that you should use to generate new sub-questions.\
For example, if the answer to a an earlier sub-question is \
'Company B and C are competitors of Company A', you should not ask now a new sub-question involving the term 'competitors', \
as you already have the information to create a more precise question - you should instead explicitly reference \
'Company B' and 'Company C' in your new sub-questions, as these are the competitors based on the previously answered question.

- Be precise(!) and don't make inferences you cannot be sure about! For example, in the previous example \
where Company B and Company C were identified as competitors of Company A, and then you also get information on \
companies D and E, do not make the inference that these are also competitors of Company A! Stick to the information you have!
(Also, don't assume that companies B and C arethe only competitors of A, unless stated!)

- Do not(!) create sub-questions that are clarifying question *to the person who asked the question*, \
like making suggestions or asking the user for more information! This is not useful for the actual \
question-answering process! You need to take the information from the user as it is given to you! \
For example, should the question be of the type 'why does product X perform poorly for customer A', DO NOT create a \
sub-question of the type 'what are the settings that customer A uses for product X?'! A valid sub-question \
could rather be 'which settings for product X have been shown to lead to poor performance for customers?'

Your task is to improve on a given answer to a question, as the initial answer was found to be lacking in some way.

Use the information provided below - and only the provided information - to write your new and improved answer.

The information provided below consists of:
  1) an initial answer that was given but likely found to be lacking in some way.
  2) a number of answered sub-questions - these are very important(!) and definitely should help you to answer the main \
question. Note that the sub-questions have a type, 'initial' and 'refined'. The 'initial' ones were available for the \
creation of the initial answer, but the 'refined' were not, they are new. So please use the 'refined' sub-questions in \
particular to update/extend/correct/enrich the initial answer and to add more details/new facts!
  3) a number of documents that were deemed relevant for the question. This is the context that you use largely for citations \
(see below). So consider the answers to the sub-questions as guidelines to construct your new answer, but make sure you cite \
the relevant document for a fact!

It is critical that you provide proper inline citations to documents in the format [D1], [D2], [D3], etc! \
Please use format [D1][D2] and NOT [D1, D2] format if you cite two or more documents together! \
It is important that the citation is close to the information it supports. \
DO NOT just list all of the citations at the very end. \
Feel free to also cite sub-questions in addition to documents, \
but make sure that you have documents cited with the sub-question citation. \
If you want to cite both a document and a sub-question, please use [D1][Q3], or [D2][D7][Q4], etc. and always place the \
document citation before the sub-question citation. Again, please NEVER cite sub-questions without a document citation! \
Proper citations are very important for the user!

REFINED_ANSWER_VALIDATION_PROMPT = f"""
{{persona_specification}}

Your task is to verify whether a given answer is truthful and accurate, and supported by the facts that you \
will be provided with.

The information provided below consists of:

  1) a question that needed to be answered

  2) a proposed answer to the question, whose accuracy you should assess

  3) potentially, a brief summary of the history of the conversation thus far, as it may give more context \
to the question. Note that the statements in the history are NOT considered as facts, ONLY but serve to to \
give context to the question.

  4) a number of answered sub-questions - you can take the answers as facts for these purposes.

  5) a number of relevant documents that should support the answer and that you should use as fact, \
i.e., if a statement in the document backs up a statement in the answer, then that statement in the answer \
should be considered as true.


IMPORTANT RULES AND CONSIDERATIONS:

 - Please consider the statements made in the proposed answer and assess whether they are truthful and accurate, based \
on the provided sub-answered and the documents. (Again, the history is NOT considered as facts!)

 - Look in particular for:
    * material statements that are not supported by the sub-answered or the documents
    * assignments and groupings that are not supported, like company A is competitor of company B, but this is not \
explicitly supported by documents or sub-answers, guesses or interpretations unless explicitly asked for

 - look also at the citations in the proposed answer and assess whether they are appropriate given the statements \
made in the proposed answer that cites the document.

 - Are items grouped together amongst one headline where not all items belong to the category of the headline? \
(Example: "Products used by Company A" where some products listed are not used by Company A)

 - Does the proposed answer address the question in full?

 - Is the answer specific to the question? Example: if the question asks for the prices for products by Company A, \
but the answer lists the prices for products by Company A and Company B, or products it cannot be sure are by \
Company A, then this is not quite specific enough to the question and the answer should be rejected.

- Similarly, if the question asks for properties of a certain class but the proposed answer lists or includes entities \
that are not of that class without very explicitly saying so, then the answer should be considered inaccurate.

 - If there are any calculations in the proposed answer that are not supported by the documents, they need to be tested. \
If any calculation is wrong, the proposed answer should be considered as not trustworthy.
